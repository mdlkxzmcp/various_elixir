# Physics

RedFour's Take Off with Elixir learning project;
Most parts are identical to the final version, with some changes applied as seen
fit. Nothing original but learned a ton. Really worth getting!

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `physics` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:physics, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/physics](https://hexdocs.pm/physics).
